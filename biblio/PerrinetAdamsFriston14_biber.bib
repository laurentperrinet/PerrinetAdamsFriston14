  ABSTRACT             = {A necessary consequence of the nature of neural transmission systems is that as change in the physical state of a time-varying event takes place, delays produce error between the instantaneous registered state and the external state. Another source of delay is the transmission of internal motor commands to muscles and the inertia of the musculoskeletal system. How does the central nervous system compensate for these pervasive delays? Although it has been argued that delay compensation occurs late in the motor planning stages, even the earliest visual processes, such as phototransduction, contribute significantly to delays. I argue that compensation is not an exclusive property of the motor system, but rather, is a pervasive feature of the central nervous system ({CNS}) organization. Although the motor planning system may contain a highly flexible compensation mechanism, accounting not just for delays but also variability in delays (e.g., those resulting from variations in luminance contrast, internal body temperature, muscle fatigue, etc.), visual mechanisms also contribute to compensation. Previous suggestions of this notion of âvisual predictionâ led to a lively debate producing re-examination of previous arguments, new analyses, and review of the experiments presented here. Understanding visual prediction will inform our theories of sensory processes and visual perception, and will impact our notion of visual awareness.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Monkeys and humans are able to perform different types of slow eye movements. The analysis of the eye movement parameters, as well as the investigation of the neuronal activity underlying the execution of slow eye movements, offer an excellent opportunity to study higher brain functions such as motion processing, sensorimotor integration, and predictive mechanisms as well as neuronal plasticity and motor learning. As an example, since there exists a tight connection between the execution of slow eye movements and the processing of any kind of motion, these eye movements can be used as a biological, behavioural probe for the neuronal processing of motion. Global visual motion elicits optokinetic nystagmus, acting as a visual gaze stabilization system. The underlying neuronal substrate consists mainly of the cortico-pretecto-olivo-cerebellar pathway. Additionally, another gaze stabilization system depends on the vestibular input known as the vestibule-ocular reflex. The interactions between the visual and vestibular stabilization system are essential to fulfil the plasticity of the vestibule-ocular reflex representing a simple form of learning. Local visual motion is a necessary prerequisite for the execution of smooth pursuit eye movements which depend on the cortico-pontino-cerebellar pathway. In the wake of saccades, short-latency eye movements can be elicited by brief movements of the visual scene. Finally, eye movements directed to objects in different planes of depth consist of slow movements also. Although there is some overlap in the neuronal substrates underlying these different types of slow eye movements, there are brain areas whose activity can be associated exclusively with the execution of a special type of slow eye movement.

  ABSTRACT             = {The function of smooth pursuit is to keep the fovea pointed at a small visual target that moves smoothly across a patterned background. Chemical lesions, single cell recordings, and behavioral measures have shown that the cortical motion processing pathways form the afferent limb for pursuit. Important areas include at least the striate cortex and the middle temporal visual area, and probably the medial superior temporal visual area and the posterior parietal cortex. We argue that the visual inputs are transmitted through a simple sensory motor interface in the pons, to the efferent limb in the brain stem and cerebellum. The efferent limb uses neural velocity memory to maintain pursuit automatically. We present evidence that the velocity memory is provided, at least in part, by eye velocity positive feedback between the flocculus of the cerebellum and the brain stem. Finally, we use a computer model to show how the maintenance of pursuit can be simulated on a millisecond time scale. The structure and internal elements of the model are based on the biological experiments reviewed in our paper. In the past five years, progress on the neural basis of pursuit eye movements has been rapid. Several areas of research have made substantial contributions, by using combinations of new and conventional methods. Many of the pathways that contribute to pursuit have been identified, and their physiological activity and functions are becoming understood. Continuing progress promises to yield an understanding of one specific form of visually guided movement, at the level of neuronal circuits and behavior, in the primate.},

  ABSTRACT             = {We previously examined the cortical processing in response to somatosensory, auditory and noxious stimuli, using magnetoencephalography in humans. Here, we performed a similar analysis of the processing in the human visual cortex for comparative purposes. After flash stimuli applied to the right eye, activations were found in eight cortical areas: the left medial occipital area around the calcarine fissure (primary visual cortex, V1), the left dorsomedial area around the parietooccipital sulcus ({DM}), the ventral ({MOv}) and dorsal ({MOd}) parts of the middle occipital area of bilateral hemispheres, the left temporo-occipito-parietal cortex corresponding to human {MT}/V5 ({hMT}), and the ventral surface of the medial occipital area ({VO}) of the bilateral hemispheres. The mean onset latencies of each cortical activity were (in ms): 27.5 (V1), 31.8 ({DM}), 32.8 (left {MOv}), 32.2 (right {MOv}), 33.4 (left {MOd}), 32.3 (right {MOv}), 37.8 ({hMT}), 46.9 (left {VO}), and 46.4 (right {VO}). Therefore the cortico-cortical connection time of visual processing at the early stage was 4--6 ms, which is very similar to the time delay between sequential activations in somatosensory and auditory processing. In addition, the activities in V1, {MOd}, {DM}, and {hMT} showed a similar biphasic waveform with a reversal of polarity after 10 ms, which is a common activation profile of the cortical activity for somatosensory, auditory, and pain-evoked responses. These results suggest similar mechanisms of the serial cortico-cortical processing of sensory information among all sensory areas of the cortex.},

  COMMENT              = {of interest: "MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA (HMT). The MT is a small visual area that exists in the temporal lobe of all primates, including humans, containing neurons that are activated by moving stimuli. This region was labeled the homologue of monkey MT/V5 (Zeki et al. 1991) and is referred to as hMT. The Talairach coordinates of the hMT source in this study (lat 46, post 70, sup 8) are in good agreement with those reported in previous studies as a motion-selective area (Zeki et al. 1991: 38, 74, 8; Watson et al. 1993: 41, 69, 2; Tootell et al. 1995: 45, 76, 3; Sunaert et al. 1999: 45, 66, 3). Although MT is known to be involved in motion perception, this region also contains neurons that are activated by flash stimuli in monkeys (Schroeder et al. 1998). A previous VEP study (Buchner et al. 1997) demonstrated a component originating from the vicinity of V5 with a peak at around 45 ms, which is consistent with our results that the hMT source activity peaked at 44.8 ms. The possible contribution of V5 to an early period of VEPs (40--75 ms) was also reported by Morand et al. (2000). The onset latency of hMT was significantly longer than that for DM and MO and, in turn, the onset latencies for DM and MO were significantly longer than that for V1. Therefore we considered that hMT was the third stage of hierarchical processing, although MT receives direct projections from the lateral geniculate nucleus (Sincich et al. 2004) and V1 (Maunsell and Van Essen 1983; Zeki 1969) in monkeys. The latency difference of 9.9 ms between V1 and hMT seems too long for a serial activation between them, compared with the 4- to 6-ms time delay between V1 and MO or DM. In a single-unit recording study in macaques by Movshon and Newsome (1996), the response latency of V1 neurons antidromically activated by stimulation in MT was 1.0--1.7 ms. As possible areas responsible for the hMT activity in this study, V2 (Anderson and Martin 2002; Maunsell and Van Essen 1983; Ungerleider and Desimone 1986) and DM (Galletti et al. 2001; Wagor et al. 1975) have been shown to send projections to MT in monkeys. A CSD study of macaques using flash stimuli (Schroeder et al. 1998) found shorter average latencies for MT than for V1, which conflicts with the present results. Their results, as well as those by Raiguel et al. (1989), suggest the possibility that MT can be driven without a relay in V1. However, Schroeder et al. (1998) also found that the latencies in the peripheral retinal representation of V1 are the shortest subset of V1 latencies and are shorter than those in MT. When the shortest latency of V1 is compared with the latency of MT (see Fig. 13 in Schroeder et al. 1998), V1 is shorter than MT by about 6--9 ms, which is consistent with the present results. Because there are several lines of evidence both in monkeys and humans that motion-selective MT neurons can be activated without a relay in V1 (Barbur et al. 1993; Girard et al. 1992; Rodman et al. 1989; Sincich et al. 2004), the hMT source in the present study might represent activities of neurons that are different from neurons that are activated selectively by moving stimuli." ---=note-separator=--- of interest: "MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA (HMT).

  ABSTRACT             = {Visual motion is an essential piece of information for both perceiving our environment and controlling our actions. The visual motion system has evolved as an exquisite machinery adapted to reconstruct the direction and speed of the object of interest within a few dozen milliseconds. In the last decade, tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of how the outputs of local motion detectors are integrated. In particular, its dynamics are now unveiled at neuronal and behavioral levels. Solutions for fundamental computational problems such as the aperture problem and the interplay between motion segmentation and integration have been proposed from these works and biologically-realistic simulations are been proposed. Such a multi-level approach is rooted in the fact that dynamics of these solutions can be tackled at different scales using similar tasks and stimuli. Dynamics of Visual Motion Processing offers an overview of recent work on the dynamics of motion integration with inter-related examples taken from physiology (both single-neuron and population activity) and psychophysics as well as sensorimotor control or active vision. The last section presents three different approaches for understanding and modeling motion perception of natural scenes, complex {3D} layout, and biological motion.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Subjects regarded targets which executed step-ramp motion in one of two conditions, either active (looking at the target) or passive (similar to the subject condition in passive or stare optokinetic nystagmus). The targets jumped 2 deg to one side and returned at a constant velocity. Targets were single round targets or extended targets with a high edge content. Many subjects showed substantial smooth eye movement responses in the passive condition, suggesting that a substantial component of initial smooth movement responses can occur independent of attention. Additional features of the smooth eye movement responses included (i) oculomotor "twitches" (brief, short-latency smooth eye movements in the step direction), (ii) overshoots (eye velocity greater than target velocity), and (iii) oscillations. Most of the response features can be accounted for by a model with a gain that is dependent on the subject's attentional level and on stimulus parameters.},

Eye velocity records were analyzed by measuring features such as the time, velocity and acceleration of the point of peak acceleration, the time and velocity of the peaks and troughs of ringing and steady-state velocity. These values were averaged and mean responses reconstructed. Three normal subjects were studied and their responses averaged. All showed a peak acceleration-velocity saturation.

  ABSTRACT             = {1. Our goal was to discriminate between two classes of models for pursuit eye movements. The monkey's pursuit system and both classes of model exhibit oscillations around target velocity during tracking of ramp target motion. However, the mechanisms that determine the frequency of oscillations differ in the two classes of model. In "internal feedback" models, oscillations are controlled by internal feedback loops, and the frequency of oscillation does not depend strongly on the delay in visual feedback. In "image motion" models, oscillations are controlled by visual feedback, and the frequency of oscillation does depend on the delay in visual feedback. 2. We measured the frequency of oscillation during pursuit of ramp target motion as a function of the total delay for visual feedback. For the shortest feedback delays of approximately 70 ms, the frequency of oscillation was between 6 and 7 Hz. Increases in feedback delay caused decreases in the frequency of oscillation. The effect of increasing feedback delay was similar, whether the increases were produced naturally by dimming and decreasing the size of the tracking target or artificially with the computer. We conclude that the oscillations in eye velocity during pursuit of ramp target motion are controlled by visual inputs, as suggested by the image motion class of models. 3. Previous experiments had suggested that the visuomotor pathways for pursuit are unable to respond well to frequencies as high as the 6-7 Hz at which eye velocity oscillates in monkeys. We therefore tested the response to target vibration at an amplitude of +/- 8 degrees/s and frequencies as high as 15 Hz. For target vibration at 6 Hz, the gain of pursuit, defined as the amplitude of eye velocity divided by the amplitude of target velocity, was as high as 0.65. We conclude that the visuomotor pathways for pursuit are capable of processing image motion at high temporal frequencies. 4. The gain of pursuit was much larger when the target vibrated around a constant speed of 15 degrees/s than when it vibrated around a stationary position. This suggests that the pursuit pathways contain a switch that must be closed to allow the visuomotor pathways for pursuit to operate at their full gain. The switch apparently remains open for target vibration around a stationary position. 5. The responses to target vibration revealed a frequency at which eye velocity lagged target velocity by 180 degrees and at which one monkey showed a local peak in the gain of {pursuit.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

  ABSTRACT             = {1. Experiments have been conducted on human subjects to determine the role of prediction in smooth eye movement control. Subjects were required to actively pursue a small target or stare passively at a larger display as it moved in the horizontal plane. 2. Target motion was basically periodic, but, after a random number of cycles an unexpected change was made in the amplitude, direction or frequency of target motion. Initially, the periodic stimulus took the form of a square waveform. In subsequent experiments, a triangular or sawtooth waveform was used, but in order to examine the timing of the response in relation to stimulus appearance, the target was tachistoscopically illuminated for 40-320 ms at the time that it passed through the mid-line position. 3. When subjects either actively pursued the target or stared passively at the larger display a characteristic pattern of steady-state eye movement was evoked composed of two phases, an initial build-up of eye velocity that reached a peak after 200 ms, followed by a decay phase with a time constant of 0.5-2 s. The build-up phase was initiated prior to target displacement for square-wave motion and before onset of target illumination for other waveforms. 4. The peak eye velocity evoked gradually increased over the first two to four cycles of repeated stimulation. Simultaneously, the response became more phase advanced, the reaction time between stimulus onset and the time at which peak velocity occurred decreasing from an average of 300 to 200 ms for triangular waveform stimuli. 5. When there was a sudden and unexpected change in amplitude and direction of the stimulus waveform, the eye movement induced had a peak velocity and direction that was inappropriate for the current visual stimulus, but which was highly correlated with the features of the preceding sequence in the stimulus. 6. When there was a sudden change in the frequency of the stimulus waveform the predictive eye movement was induced with a timing appropriate to the periodicity of the previous sequence but inappropriate to the new sequence. 7. The results indicate that prediction is carried out through the storage of information about both the magnitude and timing of eye velocity. The trajectory of the averaged eye velocity response was similar in form irrespective of the duration of target exposure or basic stimulus frequency, suggesting that the predictive estimate is released as a stereotyped volley of constant duration but varying magnitude under the control of a periodicity {estimator.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

  ABSTRACT             = {Ocular pursuit movements allow moving objects to be tracked with a combination of smooth movements and saccades. The principal objective is to maintain smooth eye velocity close to object velocity, thus minimising retinal image motion and maintaining acuity. Saccadic movements serve to realign the image if it falls outside the fovea, the area of highest acuity. Pursuit movements are often portrayed as voluntary but their basis lies in processes that sense retinal motion and can induce eye movements without active participation. The factor distinguishing pursuit from such reflexive movements is the ability to select and track a single object when presented with multiple stimuli. The selective process requires attention, which appears to raise the gain for the selected object and/or suppress that associated with other stimuli, the resulting competition often reducing pursuit velocity. Although pursuit is essentially a feedback process, delays in motion processing create problems of stability and speed of response. This is countered by predictive processes, probably operating through internal efference copy (extra-retinal) mechanisms using short-term memory to store velocity and timing information from prior stimulation. In response to constant velocity motion, the initial response is visually driven, but extra-retinal mechanisms rapidly take over and sustain pursuit. The same extra-retinal mechanisms may also be responsible for generating anticipatory smooth pursuit movements when past experience creates expectancy of impending object motion. Similar, but more complex, processes appear to operate during periodic pursuit, where partial trajectory information is stored and released in anticipation of expected future motion, thus minimising phase errors associated with motion processing delays.},

  ABSTRACT             = {It has been established that repeated presentation of a transient target motion stimulus such as a constant-velocity ramp leads to the build up of steady state ({SS}), anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements after two or three presentations. Each {SS} response is then composed of the anticipatory component of nonvisual origin, a visual component associated with the stimulus presentation and another nonvisual component that represents the decay of the response after extinction of the stimulus. Here we investigated the interactions that occur when each motion stimulus was itself a sequence containing more than one ramp component. Ramp components had a velocity of 15 degrees /s or 30 degrees /s to left or right and were separated by gaps of 200 ms duration. In an initial experiment, responses to 2-ramp stimuli were examined and compared with responses to the single-ramp stimuli from which they were constituted. We present evidence that the anticipatory, nonvisual components of the double-ramp response result from the linear summation of the nonvisual components of the responses to the constituent single-ramp components. In a 2nd experiment, we examined responses to a wide variety of 4-ramp sequences and again found evidence that, in the {SS}, the responses were formed from the linear summation of the constituent single-ramp components. Regression analysis performed on the velocity at onset of each ramp component indicated that this nonvisual part of the response was predictive of the upcoming ramp component. To confirm this, unexpected changes were introduced into single ramp components of the 4-ramp sequence after at least five prior presentations of the sequence had allowed a {SS} response to be established. Subjects continued to initiate a response to the modified component that was appropriate in velocity and direction for the corresponding part of the previous sequence and inappropriate for the newly modified stimulus. This preprogrammed response persisted unmodified for more than 170 ms after onset of the modified ramp component. In contrast, in the second presentation of the new sequence, the anticipatory component of the response was highly correlated with the {SS} response of the new sequence, but not with that of the prior sequence, showing that the preprogrammed response had been modified very rapidly. Similar behaviour was observed whichever of the 4-ramp components was modified, indicating that the velocity and direction of the anticipatory response to each component had been preprogrammed. The results suggest that velocity information related to at least four elements of a sequence can be temporarily stored and subsequently released with appropriate temporal order to form an anticipatory response throughout the whole sequence.},

  ABSTRACT             = {The link between anticipatory smooth eye movements and prediction in sinusoidal pursuit was investigated by presentation of series of identical, single-cycle, sinusoidal target motion stimuli. Stimuli occurred at randomized intervals (1.2-2.8 s) but were preceded by an audio warning cue 480 ms before each presentation. Cycle period (T) varied from 0.64 to 2.56 s and target displacement from 4 to 20 degrees in separate series. For T </= 1.28 s, responses to the first stimulus of each series exhibited a time delay across the whole cycle (mean = 121 ms for T = 0.8 s). But, in the second and subsequent (steady-state) presentations, anticipatory movements, proportional to target velocity, were made and time delay was significantly reduced (mean = 43 ms for T = 0.8 s). Steady-state time delays were comparable to those evoked during continuous sinusoidal pursuit and less than pursuit reaction time. Even when subjects did not follow the target in the first presentation, they responded to the second presentation with reduced time delay. Throughout the experiments, three types of catch trial ({A-C}) were introduced. In A, the target failed to appear as expected after the warning cue. Anticipatory smooth movements were initiated, reaching a peak velocity proportional to prior target velocity around 200 ms after expected target onset. In B, the target stopped midway through the cycle. Even if the target remained on and was stationary, the eye movement continued to be driven away from the stationary target with a velocity similar to that of prior responses, reaching a peak velocity that was again proportional to expected target velocity after >/=205 ms. In C, the amplitude of the single sinusoid was unexpectedly increased or decreased. When it decreased, eye velocity throughout the first half-cycle of the response was close to that executed in response to prior stimuli of higher velocity and did not return to an appropriate level for 382-549 ms. Conversely, when amplitude increased, eye velocity remained inappropriately low for the first half-cycle. Results of A and C indicate that subjects are able to use velocity information stored from prior presentations to initiate an oculomotor drive that predominates over visual feedback for the first half-cycle. Results of B indicate that the second part of the cycle is also preprogrammed because it continued despite efforts to suppress it by fixation. The results suggest that initial retinal velocity error information can be sampled, stored, and subsequently replayed as a bi-directional anticipatory pattern of movement that reduces temporal delay and could account for predictive control during sinusoidal pursuit.},

  ABSTRACT             = {In motor control, prediction of future events is vital for overcoming sensory-motor processing delays and facilitating rapid and accurate responses in a dynamic environment. In human ocular pursuit this is so pervasive that prediction of future target motion cannot easily be eliminated by randomizing stimulus parameters. We investigated the prediction of temporally randomized events during pursuit of alternating constant-velocity (ramp) stimuli in which the timing of direction changes varied unpredictably over a given range. Responses were not reactive; instead, smooth eye velocity began to decelerate in anticipation of each target reversal. In the first experiment, using a continuous-motion stimulus, we found that the time at which this occurred was relatively constant regardless of ramp duration, but increased as mean ramp duration of the range increased. Regression analysis revealed a quantitative association between deceleration timing and the previous two or three ramp durations in a trial, suggesting that recent stimulus history was used to create a running average of anticipatory timing. In the second experiment, we used discrete motion stimuli, with intervening periods of fixation, which allowed both target velocity and reversal timing to be varied, thereby decoupling ramp duration and displacement. This enabled us to confirm that the timing of anticipatory deceleration was based on the history of timing, rather than displacement, within the stimulus. We conclude that this strategy is used to minimize error amid temporal uncertainty, while simultaneously overcoming inherent delays in visuomotor processing.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Smooth pursuit eye movements reflect the temporal dynamics of bidimensional ({2D}) visual motion integration. When tracking a single, tilted line, initial pursuit direction is biased toward unidimensional ({1D}) edge motion signals, which are orthogonal to the line orientation. Over 200 ms, tracking direction is slowly corrected to finally match the {2D} object motion during steady-state pursuit. We now show that repetition of line orientation and/or motion direction does not eliminate the transient tracking direction error nor change the time course of pursuit correction. Nonetheless, multiple successive presentations of a single orientation/direction condition elicit robust anticipatory pursuit eye movements that always go in the {2D} object motion direction not the {1D} edge motion direction. These results demonstrate that predictive signals about target motion cannot be used for an efficient integration of ambiguous velocity signals at pursuit initiation.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Oculomotor abnormality is one of the endophenotypes in schizophrenia. The predictive component of smooth pursuit can be studied by comparing the gain, i.e., the ratio of smooth eye position to target position, during predictable (pure sinusoidal) and unpredictable (pseudorandom) target motions. The aim of this experiment was to study predictive and nonpredictive components of smooth pursuit in two groups of schizophrenia patients compared with control subjects. Fifty-one schizophrenia patients (40 nondeficit and 11 deficit) and 21 control subjects were studied. During a predictable task, subjects were asked to track a sinusoidal target (.4 Hz). For the unpredictable task, the pseudorandom target motion consisted of five superimposed sinusoidal waveforms (.1, .2, .4, .6, and .8 Hz). The smooth eye position (eye position without saccades), gain, and phase were calculated for each frequency in each participant and for both tasks. The mean sinusoidal smooth eye position gain was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects with no significant difference between deficit and nondeficit patients. During the pseudorandom task, all groups had a similar gain at .4 Hz. Our study reveals that patients have a normal nonpredictive component of smooth pursuit, regardless of their level of negative symptoms. In contrast, the predictive mechanisms involved in eye pursuit were impaired in schizophrenia patients. These results indicate that poor pursuit performance during smooth pursuit is primarily a consequence of a predictive problem and is not related to the ability to generate an accurate pursuit maintenance response.

  ABSTRACT             = {In order to understand mechanisms underlying the smooth pursuit abnormality(ies) in schizophrenia, new methods, which independently evaluated predictive smooth pursuit responses to extra-retinal motion signals, were developed and tested. The study compared responses to only extra-retinal motion signals in normal volunteers (n = 25), and individuals with a chronic (n = 21) and a recent onset (n = 18) schizophrenia. Subject groups with chronic schizophrenia and recent onset schizophrenia had significantly poorer predictive pursuit than normal subjects in response to only extra-retinal motion signals. The poor predictive pursuit was evident even at low target velocity when the closed-loop pursuit gain was normal in patients with schizophrenia. Ten of the 18 recent onset patients were drug-free at the time of testing and had no or minimum previous exposure to anti-psychotic medications. Re-analyses of the data showed that on most measures of predictive pursuit, drug-free patients were not significantly different from patients who received anti-psychotic drug treatment. Both patient groups had significantly poorer predictive pursuit than normal subjects. These results suggest that a deficit in processing extra-retinal motion may underlie the abnormal smooth pursuit response in schizophrenia. At low target velocities, patients with schizophrenia were able to compensate for the low extra-retinal gain by increasing the gain of response to the retinal slip velocity. This indicates that patients were able to process retinal slip velocity and generate smooth pursuit eye movements, but experienced a specific deficit in processing and/or integrating extra-retinal motion information for the smooth pursuit response.},

  ABSTRACT             = {An implicit, underlying assumption of most {Helmholtzian/Bayesian} approaches to perception is the hypothesis that the scene an observer perceives is the probable source of the proximal stimulus. There is, however, a nontrivial latency (on the order of 100 ms) between the time of a proximal stimulus and the time a visual percept is elicited. It seems plausible that it would be advantageous for an observer to have, at any time t, a percept representative of what is out there at that very time t, not a percept of the recent past. If this is so, it implies a modification to the implicit hypothesis underlying most existing probabilistic approaches to perception: the new hypothesis is that, given the proximal stimulus, the scene an observer perceives is the probable scene present at the time of the percept. That is, the hypothesis is that what an observer perceives is not the probable source of the proximal stimulus, but the probable way the probable source will be when the percept actually occurs. A model of an observer's typical movements in the world is developed, and it is shown that projected angles are perceived in a way consistent with the way the probable source will project to the eye after a small time period of forward movement by the observer. The predicted and actual direction of projected-angle misperception is sometimes toward 90ø and sometimes away from 90ø, depending on whether the probable source angle is lying in a plane parallel or perpendicular to the probable direction of motion, respectively. The perception of angular size for lines in a figure with cues they are lying in a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion is also shown to fit the predictions of the model.},

  ABSTRACT             = {There is a significant delay between the time when light hits the retina and the time of the consequent percept. It has been hypothesized that the visual system attempts to correct for this latency by generating a percept representative of the way the world probably is at the time the percept is elicited, rather than a percept of the recent past. Here we show that such a 'perceiving the present' hypothesis explains a number of classical geometrical illusions: the Hering, Orbison, {Müller-Lyer}, Double Judd, Poggendorff, Corner, and {Upside-down-T} illusions. Each stimulus is perceived as it would project in the next moment were the observer moving through the scene the stimulus probably represents. We also examine one general class of predictions made by the hypothesis, and report psychophysical experiments confirming the predictions.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Over the history of the study of visual perception there has been great success at discovering countless visual illusions. There has been less success in organizing the overwhelming variety of illusions into empirical generalizations (much less explaining them all via a unifying theory). Here, this article shows that it is possible to systematically organize more than 50 kinds of illusion into a 7 times 4 matrix of 28 classes. In particular, this article demonstrates that (1) smaller sizes, (2) slower speeds, (3) greater luminance contrast, (4) farther distance, (5) lower eccentricity, (6) greater proximity to the vanishing point, and (7) greater proximity to the focus of expansion all tend to have similar perceptual effects, namely, to (A) increase perceived size, (B) increase perceived speed, (C) decrease perceived luminance contrast, and (D) decrease perceived distance. The detection of these empirical regularities was motivated by a hypothesis, called "perceiving the present", that the visual system possesses mechanisms for compensating neural delay during forward motion. This article shows how this hypothesis predicts the empirical regularity.},

  ABSTRACT             = {The slow speed of neural transmission necessitates that cortical visual information from dynamic scenes will lag reality. The "perceiving the present" ({PTP}) hypothesis suggests that the visual system can mitigate the effect of such delays by spatially warping scenes to look as they will in \~{}100 ms from now (Changizi, 2001). We here show that the Hering illusion, in which straight lines appear bowed, can be induced by a background of optic flow, consistent with the {PTP} hypothesis. However, importantly, the bowing direction is the same whether the flow is inward or outward. This suggests that if the warping is meant to counteract latencies, it is accomplished by a simple strategy that is insensitive to motion direction, and that works only under typical (forward-moving) circumstances. We also find that the illusion strengthens with longer pulses of optic flow, demonstrating motion integration over \~{}80 ms. The illusion is identical whether optic flow precedes or follows the flashing of bars, exposing the spatial warping to be equally postdictive and predictive, i.e., peri-dictive. Additionally, the illusion is diminished by cues which suggest the bars are independent of the background movement. Collectively, our findings are consistent with a role for networks of visual orientation-tuned neurons (e.g., simple cells in primary visual cortex) in spatial warping. We conclude that under the common condition of forward ego-motion, spatial warping counteracts the disadvantage of neural latencies. It is not possible to prove that this is the purpose of spatial warping, but our findings at minimum place constraints on the {PTP} hypothesis, demonstrating that any spatial warping for the purpose of counteracting neural delays is not a precise, on-the-fly computation, but instead a heuristic achieved by a simple mechanism that succeeds under normal circumstances.},

  ABSTRACT             = {The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the {Bode-Shannon} representation of random processes and the '' state-transition'' method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

@ARTICLE{Friston10a,
  ABSTRACT             = {We have previously tried to explain perceptual inference and learning under a free-energy principle that pursues Helmholtz's agenda to understand the brain in terms of energy minimization. It is fairly easy to show that making inferences about the causes of sensory data can be cast as the minimization of a free-energy bound on the likelihood of sensory inputs, given an internal model of how they were caused. In this article, we consider what would happen if the data themselves were sampled to minimize this bound. It transpires that the ensuing active sampling or inference is mandated by ergodic arguments based on the very existence of adaptive agents. Furthermore, it accounts for many aspects of motor behavior; from retinal stabilization to goal-seeking. In particular, it suggests that motor control can be understood as fulfilling prior expectations about proprioceptive sensations. This formulation can explain why adaptive behavior emerges in biological agents and suggests a simple alternative to optimal control theory. We illustrate these points using simulations of oculomotor control and then apply to same principles to cued and goal-directed movements. In short, the free-energy formulation may provide an alternative perspective on the motor control that places it in an intimate relationship with perception.},

  ABSTRACT             = {If perception corresponds to hypothesis testing (Gregory, 1980); then visual searches might be construed as experiments that generate sensory data. In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free-energy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Given sufficient exposure to stimulus presentation, the oculomotor system generates a representation of the stimulus characteristics, which is then used to predict the upcoming target motion. In addition to compensating for the perceptual-motor delay, these predictive processes perpetuate eye motion during a transient occlusion and compensate for the loss of visual input. At present, however, it is not well understood whether and how the oculomotor system extracts and represents target acceleration for subsequent predictive control. To this end, we used a target occlusion paradigm where both position and velocity of the target during the occlusion and at reappearance could not be predicted without extracting target acceleration before target disappearance. We found that the oculomotor response during the blanking period was not influenced by target acceleration when the initial exposure was 200 ms. However, smooth and saccadic eye movements did discriminate between the different levels of acceleration after an initial 500- or 800-ms exposure. In the event that the smooth response during the occlusion did not match well the target trajectory and thus eliminate a developing displacement error, there was an increased saccadic displacement. Still, the combined response during the blanking period did not eliminate retinal slip and position error at target reappearance. These results indicate that information on target acceleration can be extracted on-line, during pursuit of a visible ramp, and then used to drive a predictive oculomotor response in the absence of visual input.},

  ABSTRACT             = {We asked whether the dynamics of target motion are represented in visual area {MT} and how information about image velocity and acceleration might be extracted from the population responses in area {MT} for use in motor control. The time course of {MT} neuron responses was recorded in anesthetized macaque monkeys during target motions that covered the range of dynamics normally seen during smooth pursuit eye movements. When the target motion provided steps of target speed, {MT} neurons showed a continuum from purely tonic responses to those with large transient pulses of firing at the onset of motion. Cells with large transient responses for steps of target speed also had larger responses for smooth accelerations than for decelerations through the same range of target speeds. Condition-test experiments with pairs of 64 msec pulses of target speed revealed response attenuation at short interpulse intervals in cells with large transient responses. For sinusoidal modulation of target speed, {MT} neuron responses were strongly modulated for frequencies up to, but not higher than, 8 Hz. The phase of the responses was consistent with a 90 msec time delay between target velocity and firing rate. We created a model that reproduced the dynamic responses of {MT} cells using divisive gain control, used the model to visualize the population response in {MT} to individual stimuli, and devised weighted-averaging computations to reconstruct target speed and acceleration from the population response. Target speed could be reconstructed if each neuron's output was weighted according to its preferred speed. Target acceleration could be reconstructed if each neuron's output was weighted according to the product of preferred speed and a measure of the size of its transient response.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex invariably involves the activation of millions of neurons that are widely distributed over its various areas. These distributed activity patterns need to be integrated into coherent representational states. A candidate mechanism for the integration and coordination of neuronal activity between different brain regions is synchronization on a fine temporal scale. In the visual cortex, synchronization occurs selectively between the responses of neurons that represent related features and that need to be integrated for the generation of coherent percepts; neurons in other areas of the cerebral cortex also synchronize their discharges. However, little is known about the patterns and the behavioural correlates of synchrony among widely separated cortical regions. Here we report that synchronization occurs between areas of the visual and parietal cortex, and between areas of the parietal and motor cortex, in the awake cat. When cats responded to a sudden change of a visual pattern, neuronal activity in cortical areas exhibited synchrony without time lags; this synchrony was particularly strong between areas subserving related functions. During reward and inter-trial episodes, zero-time-lag synchrony was lost and replaced by interactions exhibiting large and unsystematic time lags.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Every eye movement produces a shift in the visual image on the retina. The receptive field, or retinal response area, of an individual visual neuron moves with the eyes so that after an eye movement it covers a new portion of visual space. For some parietal neurons, the location of the receptive field is shown to shift transiently before an eye movement. In addition, nearly all parietal neurons respond when an eye movement brings the site of a previously flashed stimulus into the receptive field. Parietal cortex both anticipates the retinal consequences of eye movements and updates the retinal coordinates of remembered stimuli to generate a continuously accurate representation of visual space.},

  ABSTRACT             = {This article poses a controversial question: is optimal control theory useful for understanding motor behavior or is it a misdirection? This question is becoming acute as people start to conflate internal models in motor control and perception (Poeppel et al., 2008; Hickok et al., 2011). However, the forward models in motor control are not the generative models used in perceptual inference. This Perspective tries to highlight the differences between internal models in motor control and perception and asks whether optimal control is the right way to think about things. The issues considered here may have broader implications for optimal decision theory and Bayesian approaches to learning and behavior in general. Copyright {\\\©} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

  COMMENT              = {* "First, we know from the physics of flow that motion cannot be specified by a single value function. Second, optimal control theory assumes that movement is caused (deter- mined) by value. However, value is an attribute of states that are caused by movement: it is a consequence, not a cause. This means that the real problem is to understand the acquisition and realization of beliefs that cause movement---in other words, to understand motor control in terms of inference and beliefs." * "In short, active inference eliminates the homunculus implicit in cost functions." * "optimal control has to invert a mapping from (1) control signals to consequences in an intrinsic (muscle-based) frame and then (2) from an intrinsic to an extrinsic (movement-based) frame in which desired movement is defined. In short, the inverse mapping comprises two parts: from an extrinsic to an intrinsic frame and from an intrinsic frame to control signals.

  ABSTRACT             = {We define predictive information {Ipred(T}) as the mutual information between the past and the future of a time series. Three qualitatively different behaviors are found in the limit of large observation times T: {Ipred(T}) can remain finite, grow logarithmically, or grow as a fractional power law. If the time series allows us to learn a model with a finite number of parameters, then {Ipred(T}) grows logarithmically with a coefficient that counts the dimensionality of the model space. In contrast, power-law growth is associated, for example, with the learning of infinite parameter (or non-parametric) models such as continuous functions with smoothness constraints. There are connections between the predictive information and measures of complexity that have been defined both in learning theory and the analysis of physical systems through statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. Furthermore, in the same way that entropy provides the unique measure of available information consistent with some simple and plausible conditions, we argue that the divergent part of {Ipred(T}) provides the unique measure for the complexity of dynamics underlying a time series. Finally, we discuss how these ideas may be useful in problems in physics, statistics, and biology.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Discovering the structure inherent in a set of patterns is a fundamental aim of statistical inference or learning. One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways.},

  ABSTRACT             = {How does the saccadic movement system select a target when visual, auditory, and planned movement commands differ? How do retinal, head-centered, and motor error coordinates interact during the selection process? Recent data on superior colliculus ({SC}) reveal a spreading wave of activation across buildup cells the peak activity of which covaries with the current gaze error. In contrast, the locus of peak activity remains constant at burst cells, whereas their activity level decays with residual gaze error. A neural model answers these questions and simulates burst and buildup responses in visual, overlap, memory, and gap tasks. The model also simulates data on multimodal enhancement and suppression of activity in the deeper {SC} layers and suggests a functional role for {NMDA} receptors in this region. In particular, the model suggests how auditory and planned saccadic target positions become aligned and compete with visually reactive target positions to select a movement command. For this to occur, a transformation between auditory and planned head-centered representations and a retinotopic target representation is learned. Burst cells in the model generate teaching signals to the spreading wave layer. Spreading waves are produced by corollary discharges that render planned and visually reactive targets dimensionally consistent and enable them to compete for attention to generate a movement command in motor error coordinates. The attentional selection process also helps to stabilize the map-learning process. The model functionally interprets cells in the superior colliculus, frontal eye field, parietal cortex, mesencephalic reticular formation, paramedian pontine reticular formation, and substantia nigra pars reticulata.},

  ABSTRACT             = {To use sensory information efficiently to make judgments and guide action in the world, the brain must represent and use information about uncertainty in its computations for perception and action. Bayesian methods have proven successful in building computational theories for perception and sensorimotor control, and psychophysics is providing a growing body of evidence that human perceptual computations are 'Bayes' optimal'. This leads to the 'Bayesian coding hypothesis': that the brain represents sensory information probabilistically, in the form of probability distributions. Several computational schemes have recently been proposed for how this might be achieved in populations of neurons. Neurophysiological data on the hypothesis, however, is almost non-existent. A major challenge for neuroscientists is to test these ideas experimentally, and so determine whether and how neurons code information about sensory uncertainty.},

  ABSTRACT             = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

  ABSTRACT             = {This article reviews a free-energy formulation that advances Helmholtz's agenda to find principles of brain function based on conservation laws and neuronal energy. It rests on advances in statistical physics, theoretical biology and machine learning to explain a remarkable range of facts about brain structure and function. We could have just scratched the surface of what this formulation offers; for example, it is becoming clear that the Bayesian brain is just one facet of the free-energy principle and that perception is an inevitable consequence of active exchange with the environment. Furthermore, one can see easily how constructs like memory, attention, value, reinforcement and salience might disclose their simple relationships within this framework.},

  ABSTRACT             = {The Bayesian framework for machine learning allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge in a coherent way, avoids overfitting problems, and provides a principled basis for selecting between alternative models. Unfortunately the computations required are usually intractable. This thesis presents a unified variational Bayesian ({VB}) framework which approximates these computations in models with latent variables using a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. Chapter 1 presents background material on Bayesian inference, graphical models, and propaga-tion algorithms. Chapter 2 forms the theoretical core of the thesis, generalising the expectation-maximisation ({EM}) algorithm for learning maximum likelihood parameters to the {VB} {EM} al-gorithm which integrates over model parameters. The algorithm is then specialised to the large family of conjugate-exponential ({CE}) graphical models, and several theorems are presented to pave the road for automated {VB} derivation procedures in both directed and undirected graphs (Bayesian and Markov networks, respectively). Chapters 3-5 derive and apply the {VB} {EM} algorithm to three commonly-used and important models: mixtures of factor analysers, linear dynamical systems, and hidden Markov models.},

  ABSTRACT             = {We describe a model of visual processing in which feedback connections from a higher- to a lower-order visual cortical area carry predictions of lower-level neural activities, whereas the feedforward connections carry the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level activities. When exposed to natural images, a hierarchical network of model neurons implementing such a model developed simple-cell-like receptive fields. A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical receptive-field effects. These results suggest that rather than being exclusively feedforward phenomena, nonclassical surround effects in the visual cortex may also result from cortico-cortical feedback as a consequence of the visual system using an efficient hierarchical strategy for encoding natural images.},

  ABSTRACT             = {This paper is a sequel to an earlier paper which proposed an active role for the thalamus, integrating multiple hypotheses formed in the cortex via the thalamo-cortical loop. In this paper, I put forward a hypothesis on the role of the reciprocal, topographic pathways between two cortical areas, one often a 'higher' area dealing with more abstract information about the world, the other 'lower', dealing with more concrete data. The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows, sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A third part of this paper will deal with extensions of these ideas to the frontal lobe.},

  ABSTRACT             = {This paper describes a general model that subsumes many parametric models for continuous data. The model comprises hidden layers of state-space or dynamic causal models, arranged so that the output of one provides input to another. The ensuing hierarchy furnishes a model for many types of data, of arbitrary complexity. Special cases range from the general linear model for static data to generalised convolution models, with system noise, for nonlinear time-series analysis. Crucially, all of these models can be inverted using exactly the same scheme, namely, dynamic expectation maximization. This means that a single model and optimisation scheme can be used to invert a wide range of models. We present the model and a brief review of its inversion to disclose the relationships among, apparently, diverse generative models of empirical data. We then show that this inversion can be formulated as a simple neural network and may provide a useful metaphor for inference and learning in the brain. Models are essential to make sense of scientific data, but they may also play a central role in how we assimilate sensory information. In this paper, we introduce a general model that generates or predicts diverse sorts of data. As such, it subsumes many common models used in data analysis and statistical testing. We show that this model can be fitted to data using a single and generic procedure, which means we can place a large array of data analysis procedures within the same unifying framework. Critically, we then show that the brain has, in principle, the machinery to implement this scheme. This suggests that the brain has the capacity to analyse sensory input using the most sophisticated algorithms currently employed by scientists and possibly models that are even more elaborate. The implications of this work are that we can understand the structure and function of the brain as an inference machine. Furthermore, we can ascribe various aspects of brain anatomy and physiology to specific computational quantities, which may help understand both normal brain function and how aberrant inferences result from pathological processes associated with psychiatric disorders.},

  ABSTRACT             = {This Perspective considers the influential notion of a canonical (cortical) microcircuit in light of recent theories about neuronal processing. Specifically, we conciliate quantitative studies of microcircuitry and the functional logic of neuronal computations. We revisit the established idea that message passing among hierarchical cortical areas implements a form of Bayesian inference---paying careful attention to the implications for intrinsic connections among neuronal populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations, one can associate specific neuronal populations with specific computational roles. This analysis discloses a remarkable correspondence between the microcircuitry of the cortical column and the connectivity implied by predictive coding. Furthermore, it provides some intuitive insights into the functional asymmetries between feedforward and feedback connections and the characteristic frequencies over which they operate.},

  ABSTRACT             = {A hypothesis about sensorimotor integration (the λ model) is described and applied to movement control and kinesthesia. The central idea is that the nervous system organizes positional frames of reference for the sensorimotor apparatus and produces active movements by shifting the frames in terms of spatial coordinates. Kinematic and electromyographic patterns are not programmed, but emerge from the dynamic interaction among the system s components, including external forces within the designated frame of reference. Motoneuronal threshold properties and proprioceptive inputs to motoneurons may be cardinal components of the physiological mechanism that produces positional frames of reference. The hypothesis that intentional movements are produced by shifting the frame of reference is extended to multi-muscle and multi-degrees-of-freedom systems with a solution of the redundancy problem that allows the control of a joint alone or in combination with other joints to produce any desired limb configuration and movement trajectory. The model also implies that for each motor behavior, the nervous system uses a strategy that minimizes the number of changeable control variables and keeps the parameters of these changes invariant. Examples are provided of simulated kinematic and electromyographic signals from single- and multi-joint arm movements produced by suggested patterns of control variables. Empirical support is provided and additional tests of the model are suggested. The model is contrasted with others based on the ideas of programming of motoneuronal activity, muscle forces, stiffness, or movement kinematics.},

  ABSTRACT             = {This paper questions the need for reinforcement learning or control theory when optimising behaviour. We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.},

@ARTICLE{Krauzlis04,
  ABSTRACT             = {Primates use a combination of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements to stabilize the retinal image of selected objects within the high-acuity region near the fovea. Pursuit has traditionally been viewed as a relatively automatic behavior, driven by visual motion signals and mediated by pathways that connect visual areas in the cerebral cortex to motor regions in the cerebellum. However, recent findings indicate that this view needs to be reconsidered. Rather than being controlled primarily by areas in extrastriate cortex specialized for processing visual motion, pursuit involves an extended network of cortical areas, and, of these, the pursuit-related region in the frontal eye fields appears to exert the most direct influence. The traditional pathways through the cerebellum are important, but there are also newly identified routes involving structures previously associated with the control of saccades, including the basal ganglia, the superior colliculus, and nuclei in the brain stem reticular formation. These recent findings suggest that the pursuit system has a functional architecture very similar to that of the saccadic system. This viewpoint provides a new perspective on the processing steps that occur as descending control signals interact with circuits in the brain stem and cerebellum responsible for gating and executing voluntary eye movements. Although the traditional view describes pursuit and saccades as two distinct neural systems, it may be more accurate to consider the two movements as different outcomes from a shared cascade of sensory-motor functions.},

@ARTICLE{Arnold09,
  ABSTRACT             = {When a brief static flash is presented in physical alignment with a moving target, the position of the flash can seem to lag behind that of the moving target. Various explanations exist. One of the most popular is the differential latency hypothesis. This assumes that neural latencies for moving stimuli are shorter than those for static stimuli. Accordingly, the flash lag would occur because perception is temporally fragmented, with moving stimuli seen before static. To test this, observers were asked to make different judgments concerning the same stimulus. Observers either judged if color changes in moving and static stimulus sections were synchronous, or whether the different stimulus sections were aligned at the time of a color change. If the flash-lag were driven by a simple differential latency, we would expect both judgments to be marked by a temporal advantage for moving stimuli. Our results suggest the contrary, as only the later judgment was marked by a flash-lag effect. The apparent timing of moving and static color changes was veridical. However, when we introduced a systematic differential latency, by modulating image contrast, both judgments were affected. Our data therefore suggest that a simple differential can modulate flash-lag type effects, but they do not cause the phenomenon.},

  ABSTRACT             = {It is well known that moving stimuli can appear to move more slowly when contrast is reduced (P. Thompson, 1982). Here we address the question whether changes in stimulus contrast also affect smooth pursuit eye movements. Subjects were asked to smoothly track a moving Gabor patch. Targets varied in velocity (1, 8, and 15 deg/s), spatial frequency (0.1, 1, 4, and 8 c/deg), and contrast, ranging from just below individual thresholds to maximum contrast. Results show that smooth pursuit eye velocity gain rose significantly with increasing contrast. Below a contrast level of two to three times threshold, pursuit gain, acceleration, latency, and positional accuracy were severely impaired. Therefore, the smooth pursuit motor response shows the same kind of slowing at low contrast that was demonstrated in previous studies on perception.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Humans can overcome the 150 ms time delay of the smooth pursuit eye movement system and track smoothly moving visual targets with zero-latency. Our target-selective adaptive control model can also overcome an inherent time delay and produce zero-latency tracking. No other model or man-made system can do this. Our model is physically realizable and physiologically realistic. The technique used in our model should be useful for analyzing other time-delay systems, such as man-machine systems and robots.},

@ARTICLE{Becker85,
  ABSTRACT             = {Eye movements were recorded in human subjects who tracked a target spot which moved horizontally at constant speeds. At random times during its trajectory, the target disappeared for variable periods of time and the subjects attempted to continue tracking the invisible target. The smooth pursuit component of their eye movements was isolated and averaged. About 190 ms after the target disappeared, the smooth pursuit velocity began to decelerate rapidly. The time course of this deceleration was similar to that in response to a visible target whose velocity decreased suddenly. After a deceleration lasting about 280 ms, the velocity stabilized at a new, reduced level which we call the residual velocity. The residual velocity remained more or less constant or declined only slowly even when the target remained invisible for 4 s. When the same target velocity was used in all trials of an experiment, the subjects' residual velocity amounted to 60\% of their normal pursuit velocity. When the velocity was varied randomly from trial to trial, the residual velocity was smaller; for target velocities of 5, 10, and 20 deg/s it reached 55, 47, and 39\% respectively. The subjects needed to see targets of unforeseeable velocity for no more than 300 ms in order to develop a residual velocity that was characteristic of the given target velocity. When a target of unknown velocity disappeared at the very moment the subject expected it to start, a smooth movement developed nonetheless and reached within 300 ms a peak velocity of 5 deg/s which was independent of the actual target velocity and reflected a "default" value for the pursuit system. Thereafter the eyes decelerated briefly and then continued with a constant or slightly decreasing velocity of 2-4 deg/s until the target reappeared. Even when the subjects saw no moving target during an experiment, they could produce a smooth movement in the dark and could grade its velocity as a function of that of an imagined target. We suggest that the residual velocity reflects a first order prediction of target movement which is attenuated by a variable gain element. When subjects are pursuing a visible target, the gain of this element is close to unity. When the target disappears but continued tracking is attempted, the gain is reduced to a value between 0.4 and 0.6.},

  ABSTRACT             = {While the predictive nature of the primate smooth pursuit system has been evident through several behavioural and neurophysiological experiments, few models have attempted to explain these results comprehensively. The model we propose in this paper in line with previous models employing optimal control theory; however, we hypothesize two new issues: (1) the medical superior temporal ({MST}) area in the cerebral cortex implements a recurrent neural network ({RNN}) in order to predict the current or future target velocity, and (2) a forward model of the target motion is acquired by on-line learning. We use stimulation studies to demonstrate how our new model supports these hypotheses.},

  ABSTRACT             = {The brain makes use of noisy sensory inputs to produce eye, head, or arm motion. In most instances, the brain combines this sensory information with predictions about future events. Here, we propose that Kalman filtering can account for the dynamics of both visually guided and predictive motor behaviors within one simple unifying mechanism. Our model relies on two Kalman filters: (1) one processing visual information about retinal input; and (2) one maintaining a dynamic internal memory of target motion. The outputs of both Kalman filters are then combined in a statistically optimal manner, i.e., weighted with respect to their reliability. The model was tested on data from several smooth pursuit experiments and reproduced all major characteristics of visually guided and predictive smooth pursuit. This contrasts with the common belief that anticipatory pursuit, pursuit maintenance during target blanking, and zero-lag pursuit of sinusoidally moving targets all result from different control systems. This is the first instance of a model integrating all aspects of pursuit dynamics within one coherent and simple model and without switching between different parallel mechanisms. Our model suggests that the brain circuitry generating a pursuit command might be simpler than previously believed and only implement the functional equivalents of two Kalman filters whose outputs are optimally combined. It provides a general framework of how the brain can combine continuous sensory information with a dynamic internal memory and transform it into motor commands.},

Although the traditional approach to the subject is almost always linear, this book recognizes and deals with the fact that real problems are most often nonlinear. <p> The first chapter offers an introductory treatment of Kalman filters with an emphasis on basic Kalman filter theory, {Rauch-Tung}-Striebel smoother, and the extended Kalman filter. Other chapters cover: <ul> <{li>An} algorithm for the training of feedforward and recurrent multilayered perceptrons, based on the decoupled extended Kalman filter ({DEKF}) <{li>Applications} of the {DEKF} learning algorithm to the study of image sequences and the dynamic reconstruction of chaotic processes <{li>The} dual estimation problem <{li>Stochastic} nonlinear dynamics: the expectation-maximization ({EM}) algorithm and the extended Kalman smoothing ({EKS}) algorithm <{li>The} unscented Kalman filter </ul> <p> Each chapter, with the exception of the introduction, includes illustrative applications of the learning algorithms described here, some of which involve the use of simulated and real-life data.

  ABSTRACT             = {The quality of the representation of an object's motion is limited by the noise in the sensory input as well as by an intrinsic ambiguity due to the spatial limi- tation of the visual motion analyzers (aperture prob- lem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that motion processing of extended ob jects is initially dominated by the local {1D} motion cues orthogonal to the ob ject's edges, whereas {2D} information takes pro- gressively over and leads to the final correct represen- tation of global motion. A Bayesian framework ac- counting for the sensory noise and general expectancies for ob ject velocities has proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning early motion processing [1, 2, 3]. However, a complete functional model, encompassing the dynamical evolution of ob- ject motion perception is still lacking. Here we outline several experimental observations concerning human smooth pursuit of moving ob jects and more particu- larly the time course of its initiation phase. In addi- tion, we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, motivated and constrained by our oculomotor data, to describe the dynamical integration of {1D} and {2D} motion information.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Accuracy in estimating an object's global motion over time is not only affected by the noise in visual motion information but also by the spatial limitation of the local motion analyzers (aperture problem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that during the initial stages of the motion information processing, {1D} motion cues related to the object's edges have a dominating influence over the estimate of the object's global motion. However, during the later stages, {2D} motion cues related to terminators (edge-endings) progressively take over, leading to a final correct estimate of the object's global motion. Here, we propose a recursive extension to the Bayesian framework for motion processing (Weiss, Simoncelli, \& Adelson, 2002) cascaded with a model oculomotor plant to describe the dynamic integration of {1D} and {2D} motion information in the context of smooth pursuit eye movements. In the recurrent Bayesian framework, the prior defined in the velocity space is combined with the two independent measurement likelihood functions, representing edge-related and terminator-related information, respectively to obtain the posterior. The prior is updated with the posterior at the end of each iteration step. The maximum-a posteriori ({MAP}) of the posterior distribution at every time step is fed into the oculomotor plant to produce eye velocity responses that are compared to the human smooth pursuit data. The recurrent model was tuned with the variance of pursuit responses to either "pure" {1D} or "pure" {2D} motion. The oculomotor plant was tuned with an independent set of oculomotor data, including the effects of line length (i.e. stimulus energy) and directional anisotropies in the smooth pursuit responses. The model not only provides an accurate qualitative account of dynamic motion integration but also a quantitative account that is close to the smooth pursuit response across several conditions (three contrasts and three speeds) for two human subjects.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Motion transparency occurs when multiple coherent motions are perceived in one spatial location. Imagine, for instance, looking out of the window of a bus on a bright day, where the world outside the window is passing by and movements of passengers inside the bus are reflected in the window. The overlay of both motions at the window leads to motion transparency, which is challenging to process. Noisy and ambiguous motion signals can be reduced using a competition mechanism for all encoded motions in one spatial location. Such a competition, however, leads to the suppression of multiple peak responses that encode different motions, as only the strongest response tends to survive. As a solution, we suggest a local center-surround competition for population-encoded motion directions and speeds. Similar motions are supported, and dissimilar ones are separated, by representing them as multiple activations, which occurs in the case of motion transparency. Psychophysical findings, such as motion attraction and repulsion for motion transparency displays, can be explained by this local competition. Besides this local competition mechanism, we show that feedback signals improve the processing of motion transparency. A discrimination task for transparent versus opaque motion is simulated, where motion transparency is generated by superimposing large field motion patterns of either varying size or varying coherence of motion. The model?s perceptual thresholds with and without feedback are calculated. We demonstrate that initially weak peak responses can be enhanced and stabilized through modulatory feedback signals from higher stages of processing.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Optic flow is an important cue for object detection. Humans are able to perceive objects in a scene using only kinetic boundaries, and can perform the task even when other shape cues are not provided. These kinetic boundaries are characterized by the presence of motion discontinuities in a local neighbourhood. In addition, temporal occlusions appear along the boundaries as the object in front covers the background and the objects that are spatially behind it. From a technical point of view, the detection of motion boundaries for segmentation based on optic flow is a difficult task. This is due to the problem that flow detected along such boundaries is generally not reliable. We propose a model derived from mechanisms found in visual areas V1, {MT}, and {MSTl} of human and primate cortex that achieves robust detection along motion boundaries. It includes two separate mechanisms for both the detection of motion discontinuities and of occlusion regions based on how neurons respond to spatial and temporal contrast, respectively. The mechanisms are embedded in a biologically inspired architecture that integrates information of different model components of the visual processing due to feedback connections. In particular, mutual interactions between the detection of motion discontinuities and temporal occlusions allow a considerable improvement of the kinetic boundary detection. A new model is proposed that uses optic flow cues to detect motion discontinuities and object occlusion. We suggest that by combining these results for motion discontinuities and object occlusion, object segmentation within the model can be improved. This idea could also be applied in other models for object segmentation. In addition, we discuss how this model is related to neurophysiological findings. The model was successfully tested both with artificial and real sequences including self and object motion.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Previous research has demonstrated learning in the pursuit system, but it is unclear whether these effects are the result of changes in visual or motor processing. The ability to maintain smooth pursuit during the transient disappearance of a visual target provides a way to assess pursuit properties in the absence of visual inputs. To study the long-term effects of learning on nonvisual signals for pursuit, we used an operant conditioning procedure. By providing a reinforcing auditory stimulus during periods of accurate tracking, we increased the pursuit velocity gain during target blanking from 0.59 in the baseline session to 0.89 after 8 to 10 daily sessions of training. Learning also reduced the occurrence of saccades. The learned effects generalized to untrained target velocities and persisted in the presence of a textured visual background. In a yoked-control group, the reinforcer was independent of the subjects' responses, and the velocity gain remained unchanged (from 0.6 to 0.63, respectively, before and after training). In a control group that received no reinforcer, gain increased slightly after repetition of the task (from 0.63 to 0.71, respectively, before and after training). Using a model of pursuit, we show that these effects of learning can be simulated by modifying the gain of an extra-retinal signal. Our results demonstrate that learned contingencies can increase eye velocity in the absence of visual signals and support the view that pursuit is regulated by extra-retinal signals that can undergo long-term plasticity.},

  ABSTRACT             = {To accurately track a moving object of interest with appropriate smooth eye movements, the brain needs to reconstruct a single velocity vector describing the global motion of this object. Because of the aperture problem (see Chap. 1), the visual system must integrate piecewise local information from either elongated edges and contours or particular features such as corners and texture elements. Here, we show that investigating smooth eye movements unveil several dynamical properties of this visual motion integration stage. Signals are weighted according to their uncertainties. The integration is highly dynamical - eye movements being always launched first in the simplest, linear (vector sum) prediction. Tracking trajectories are then progressively adjusted to match the object trajectory after 200 ms of pursuit. Such strategy is immune to higher factors such as prediction about incoming {2D} target trajectory. On the contrary, mixing retinal and extra-retinal signals become important later during the pursuit to accommodate partial or total object motion occlusion for instance. We propose a framework computing and representing object motion through two recurrent loops ({V1-MT} and {MST}-{FEF}, respectively), with area {MST} playing the role of gear. Such architecture would accommodate two important constraints of motor behavior: quick reaction to a new visual event and utilization of extra-retinal information to smooth out transient changes in the image such as those occurring when an object moves in a crowded environment.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Schizophrenia patients exhibit several smooth pursuit abnormalities including poor pursuit initiation. Velocity discrimination is also impaired and is correlated with pursuit initiation performance-suggesting that pursuit deficits are related to impairments in processing velocity information. Studies suggest that pursuit initiation is influenced by prior target motion information and/or expectations and that this is likely caused by expectation-based changes in the perceptual inputs to the pursuit system. We examined whether poor pursuit initiation in schizophrenia results from inaccurate encoding of immediate velocity signals, or whether these deficits reflect a failure to use prior target motion information to "optimize" the response. Twenty-eight patients and 24 controls performed an adapted version of a "remembered pursuit task." Trials consisted of a series of target motions, the first of which occurred unexpectedly, followed by four to seven identical targets each preceded by an auditory cue and a "catch target" in which a cue was given followed by target extinction. Initiation eye velocity in response to unexpected, first targets was similar in the patient and control groups. In contrast, patients showed lower eye velocity in response to repeated, cued targets compared with controls. Patients also showed reduced eye velocity in response to catch targets. Reduction in pursuit latency across repeated targets was less robust in patients. Results suggest that processing of immediate velocity information is unaffected in schizophrenia and that pursuit initiation deficits reflect an inability to accurately generate, store, and/or access "remembered" velocity signals.},

  ABSTRACT             = {The machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensori-motor transformation, such as in Ocular Following Response (OFR), is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilis- tic framework by using Bayesian theory (Weiss et al., 2002) which we previously proved to be successfully adapted to model the OFR for different levels of noise with full field gratings (Perrinet et al., 2005). More recent experiments of OFR have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dy- namics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the spatial integration of motion : (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving OFR, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective sup- pressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stim- uli (Barthélemy et al., 2006). Herein, we extended the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a proba- bilistic representation. We present analytical results which show that the hypoth- esis of independence of local measures can describe the integration of the spatial motion signal. Within this framework, we successfully accounted for the con- trast gain control mechanisms observed in the behavioral data for center-surround stimuli. However, another inhibitory mechanism had to be added to account for suppressive effects of the surround.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Human visual speed perception is qualitatively consistent with a Bayesian observer that optimally combines noisy measurements with a prior preference for lower speeds. Quantitative validation of this model, however, is difficult because the precise noise characteristics and prior expectations are unknown. Here, we present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities.},

@ARTICLE{Bogadhi11a,
  ABSTRACT             = {Due to the aperture problem, the initial direction of tracking responses to a translating tilted bar is biased towards the direction orthogonal to the orientation of the bar. This directional error is largely reduced over the first 200 ms of tracking, consistent with the neural solution of the aperture problem (Pack \& Born, 2001) and is fully corrected during the steady-state. We have proposed that pursuit dynamics reflects that of visual motion processing and can be modeled as a dynamical Bayesian inference of {2D} target motion (Bogadhi et al., 2010). Such simple paradigm also offers a powerful way to explore interactions between sensory and predictive signals in controlling action (Montagnini et al., 2006). We conducted two experiments to investigate these interactions by transiently blanking the target at different moments of pursuit. First, a 45$\,^{\circ}$ or 135$\,^{\circ}$ tilted bar translating horizontally was blanked for four different durations (0, 200, 400 and 800 ms) during steady-state tracking. Bar orientation after reappearance changed on half of the trials. We found a marginal directional bias (compared to initial bias) when the target reappeared with no change of orientation and when target changed orientation with no transient blanking. However, there was a significant directional bias when the target reappeared with a change in orientation. Second, the target (an upright or a 45$\,^{\circ}$ tilted line) was blanked (duration: 200 ms) on half of the trials during the initiation phase of pursuit, starting at either 100 or 180 ms after pursuit onset. Line orientation was constant. We found a significant directional bias (i.e. equal to the initial bias) when 45$\,^{\circ}$ tilted line reappeared after a 200 ms blank starting at 100 ms. Such bias was marginal when the target reappeared after a 200 ms blank starting at 180 ms. These results suggest for a conditionally weighted mixing of retinal and extra retina signals in driving smooth pursuit.},

@REPORT{Tlapale10benchmark,
  ABSTRACT             = {Offering proper evaluation methodology is essential to continue progress in modelling neural mechanisms in vision/visual information processing. Currently, evaluation of motion estimation models lacks a proper methodology for comparing their performance against the visual system. Here, we set the basis for such a new benchmark methodology which is based on human visual performance as measured in psychophysics, ocular following and neurobiology. This benchmark will enable comparisons between different kinds of models, but also it will challenge current motion estimation models and better characterize their properties with respect to visual cortex performance. To do so, we propose a database of image sequences taken from neuroscience and psychophysics literature. In this article, we focus on two aspects of motion estimation, which are the dynamics of motion integration and the respective influence between {1D} versus {2D} cues. Then, since motion models possibly deal with different kinds of motion representations and scale, we define here two general readouts based on a global motion estimation. Such readouts, namely eye movements and perceived motion will serve as a reference to compare simulated and experimental data. We evaluate the performance of several models on this data to establish the current state of the art. Models chosen for comparison have very different properties and internal mechanisms, such as feedforward normalisation of V1 and {MT} processing and recurrent feedback. As a whole, we provide here the basis for a valuable evaluation methodology to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of the visual cortex in motion perception. Our database is freely available on the web together with scoring instructions and results at http://www-sop.inria.fr/neuromathcomp/software/motionpsychobench},

@ARTICLE{Adams12,
  ABSTRACT             = {This paper introduces a model of oculomotor control during the smooth pursuit of occluded visual targets. This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle -- the minimisation of variational free energy -- to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements -- prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Photoreceptors strongly attenuate high temporal frequencies. Hence when an image moves, high spatial frequency components are lost if their direction of modulation coincides with the direction of movement, but not if it is orthogonal. The power spectra of natural images are remarkably consistent in having a 1/f 2 falloff in power in all directions. For moving images, the spatial power spectra will be distorted by becoming steeper in the direction corresponding to modulation in the direction of motion, and the contours of equal power will tend to become elliptical. This study demonstrates that the mammalian visual system is specifically sensitive to such anisotropic changes of the local power spectrum, and it is suggested that these distortions are used to determine patterns of optic flow. Convergent evidence from work on Glass figures, motion streaks, and sensitivity to {non-Cartesian} gratings is called on in support of this interpretation, which has been foreshadowed in several recent publications.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Typical natural visual scenes contain many objects, which need to be segregated from each other and from the background. Present theories subdivide the processes responsible for this segregation into a pre-attentive and attentive system. The pre-attentive system segregates image regions that 'pop out' rapidly and in parallel across the visual field. In the primary visual cortex, responses to pre-attentively selected image regions are enhanced. When objects do not segregate automatically from the rest of the image, the time-consuming attentive system is recruited. Here we investigate whether attentive selection is also associated with a modulation of firing rates in area V1 of the brain in monkeys trained to perform a curve-tracing task. Neuronal responses to the various segments of a target curve were simultaneously enhanced relative to responses evoked by a distractor curve, even if the two curves crossed each other. This indicates that object-based attention is associated with a response enhancement at the earliest level of the visual cortical processing hierarchy.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Predictive coding models suggest that predicted sensory signals are attenuated (silencing of prediction error). These models, though influential, are challenged by the fact that prediction sometimes seems to enhance rather than reduce sensory signals, as in the case of attentional cueing experiments. One possible explanation is that in these experiments, prediction (i.e., stimulus probability) is confounded with attention (i.e., task relevance), which is known to boost rather than reduce sensory signal. However, recent theoretical work on predictive coding inspires an alternative hypothesis and suggests that attention and prediction operate synergistically to improve the precision of perceptual inference. This model posits that attention leads to heightened weighting of sensory evidence, thereby reversing the sensory silencing by prediction. Here, we factorially manipulated attention and prediction in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study and distinguished between these 2 hypotheses. Our results support a predictive coding model wherein attention reverses the sensory attenuation of predicted signals.},

  ABSTRACT             = {In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and {fMRI} responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise {fMRI} experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Choosing an appropriate set of stimuli is essential to characterize the response of a sensory system to a particular functional dimension, such as the eye movement following the motion of a visual scene. Here, we describe a framework to generate random texture movies with controlled information content, i.e., Motion Clouds. These stimuli are defined using a generative model that is based on controlled experimental parametrization. We show that Motion Clouds correspond to dense mixing of localized moving gratings with random positions. Their global envelope is similar to natural-like stimulation with an approximate full-field translation corresponding to a retinal slip. We describe the construction of these stimuli mathematically and propose an open-source Python-based implementation. Examples of the use of this framework are shown. We also propose extensions to other modalities such as color vision, touch, and audition.},

  ABSTRACT             = {Treatment of the predictive aspect of statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference is extended to the density-matrix formalism and applied to a discussion of the relation between irreversibility and information loss. A principle of "statistical complementarity" is pointed out, according to which the empirically verifiable probabilities of statistical mechanics necessarily correspond to incomplete predictions. A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of {radiation.It} is shown that a density matrix does not in general contain all the information about a system that is relevant for predicting its behavior. In the case of a system perturbed by random fluctuating fields, the density matrix cannot satisfy any differential equation because ρ̇(t) does not depend only on ρ(t), but also on past conditions The rigorous theory involves stochastic equations in the type {ρ(t)=G}(t, 0)ρ(0), where the operator G is a functional of conditions during the entire interval (0→t). Therefore a general theory of irreversible processes cannot be based on differential rate equations corresponding to time-proportional transition probabilities. However, such equations often represent useful approximations.},
